# MOOC Lecture Video and Content Integration with Associated Textbook

## DESCRIPTION

The chosen topic is Intelligent Learning Platform and the integration of lecture videos with content of textbook.  Often when learning within the MOOC platform, students may tend to go through only the associated video lectures and power point slides.  

The professor usually provides a textbook as a reference to support the materials covered in the videos.

As students we all dream of a world where we can read the associated textbook cover to cover (or perhaps just me) so that each point mentioned in the lectures can be corelated with a specific section within the text. This has the benefit of reinforcing the learning experience.

The problem is that we rarely have the luxury of time to read a textbook cover to cover, which may lead us to overlook valuable information.  This project is an attempt to assist students with a tool that will build the association between a textbook and MOOC lecture, so that the full power of a textbook can be utilized to enhance and expand the learning experience.
