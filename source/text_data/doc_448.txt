Joint Analysis of Text and Structured Data
retrieval, email retrieval, and subtopic retrieval, which are connected to some tasks
introduced in TREC over the years). The results on the bottom show that before
the language modeling paper was published in 1998, the study of retrieval models
focused on probabilistic, logic, and Boolean models, but after 1998, there was a
clear focus on language modeling approaches and parameter estimation, which is
an integral part of studies of language models for IR. Thus, these results can help
potentially reveal the impact of an event as reflected in the text data.

Topic Analysis with Social Networks as Context
In this section, we discuss how to mine text data with a social network as context.
The context of a text article can sometimes form a network; the authors of research
articles might form collaboration networks. Similarly, authors of social media
content might form social networks via a social network platform such as Twitter
or Facebook. For example, in Twitter, people might follow each other, whereas in
Facebook, people might be friends. Such a network context can indirectly connect
the content written by the authors involved in a network.
Similarly, locations associated with text can also be connected to form geograph-
ical networks, which again add indirect connections between text data that would
otherwise not be directly connected.
In general, you can imagine the metadata of the text data can easily form a
network if we can identify some relations among the metadata. When we have
network context available, it offers an interesting opportunity to jointly analyze
text and its associated network context. The benefit of such a joint analysis is as
follows. First, we can use a network to impose some constraints on topics of text.
For example, it’s reasonable to assume that authors connected in collaboration
networks tend to write about similar topics. Such heuristics can be used to guide us
in analyzing topics. Second, text can also help characterize the content associated
with each subnetwork. For example, the difference between the opinions expressed
in two subnetworks can be revealed by doing this type of joint analysis.
We now introduce a specific technique for analysis of text with network as
context called a network supervised topic model. The general idea of such a model
is illustrated in Figure 19.10. First, we can view any generative model (e.g., PLSA) as
defining an optimization problem where the variables are the parameters (denoted
by � here in the figure), and the objective function is the likelihood function.
From the perspective of mining text data, the estimated parameter values �∗ can
be regarded as the output of the mining algorithm based on the model. With
this view, we can then potentially use any context information of the text data to
impose constraints or preferences on the parameters so as to incorporate domain
