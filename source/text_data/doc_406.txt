Topic Analysis
[2007] is a short summary of topic models alone. In the exercises, we mention su-
pervised LDA [McAuliffe and Blei 2008]. There are many other variants of LDA such
as MedLDA [Zhu et al. 2009] (another supervised model which attempts to maxi-
mize the distance between classes) and LabeledLDA [Ramage et al. 2009] (which
incorporates metadata tags).
Exercises
17.1. What is the input and output of the two-topic mixture model?
17.2. What is the input and output of PLSA?
17.3. For a product review dataset, there are k different product types. The true
value of k is in the range [2, 5]. How many product types do you think there were?
How can you use topic analysis to help you? (A product type is something like “CPU”
or “router”).
17.4. Give an idea about how you could use topic models to enhance search results.
What type of access mode does your suggestion support?
17.5. Give an idea about how you could use topic models for a document represen-
tation in vector space. What does a similarity measure capture for this representa-
tion?
17.6. Sketch an idea about how you could use PLSA to model topical trends over
time, given a dataset of documents that are tagged with dates.
17.7. Chapter 18 discusses sentiment analysis and opinion mining. In order to
discoverpositiveandnegativesentimenttopics, wesetk = 2andrunatopicanalysis
method. What is an issue with this idea?
17.8. We mentioned that PLSA is a discriminative model and LDA is a generative
model. Discuss how these differences affect:
(a) defining the model,
(b) incorporating prior knowledge,
(c) learning the model parameters (inference), and
(d) applying the model to new data.
17.9. An alternative topic analysis evaluation scheme is to hold out a certain num-
ber of words in the vocabulary from some documents. Explain how this can be
used to evaluate topic models. Does this evaluate the topic-document distributions,
topic-word distributions, or both?
