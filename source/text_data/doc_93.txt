Overview of Text
Data Access
Text data access is the foundation for text analysis. Text access technology plays two
important roles in text management and analysis applications. First, it enables re-
trieval of the most relevant text data to a particular analysis problem, thus avoiding
unnecessary overhead from processing a large amount of non-relevant data. Sec-
ond, it enables interpretation of any analysis results or discovered knowledge in
appropriate context and provides data provenance (origin).
The general goal of text data access is to connect users with the right information
at the right time. This connection can be done in two ways: pull, where the users
take the initiative to fetch relevant information out from the system, and push,
where the system takes the initiative to offer relevant information to users. In this
chapter, we will give a high-level overview of these two modes of text data access.
Then, we will formalize and motivate the problem of text retrieval. In the following
chapters, we will cover specific techniques for supporting text access in both push
and pull modes.

Access Mode: Pull vs. Push
Because text data are created for consumption by humans, humans play an impor-
tant role in text data analysis and management applications. Specifically, humans
can help select the most relevant data to a particular application problem, which
is beneficial since it enables us to avoid processing the huge amount of raw text
data (which would be inefficient) and focus on analyzing the most relevant part.
Selecting relevant text data from a large collection is the basic task of text access.
This selection is generally based on a specification of the information need of an
analyst (a user), and can be done in two modes: pull and push. Figure 5.1 describes
how these modes fit together along with querying and browsing.
