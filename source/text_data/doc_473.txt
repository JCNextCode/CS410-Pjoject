META as a Unified System
In this section, we discuss some interesting possibilities of extending META to a
general and unified text data management and analysis system. In one direction, we

search engine to support various topic models, which can further enable improved
text categorization, text summarization, and text clustering.
Indexes (forward and inverted) are a common storage mechanism for most
text mining applications in META. Analyzers and tokenizers are the first operators
applied on text, where various features are created and term IDs are assigned. If
the terms are not stored in an index, they are usually stored in a meta::sequence,
which maintains term order for further analysis. Additionally, most text mining
applications take an index as input.
