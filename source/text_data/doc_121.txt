6.3 Vector Space Retrieval Models
101
the IDF function is an open research question. With the evaluation skills you will
learn in Chapter 9, you can test your different instantiations.
If we use a linear function like the diagonal line (as shown in the figure), it may
not be as reasonable as the IDF function we just defined. In the standard IDF,
we have a dropping off point where we say “these terms are essentially not very
useful.” This makes sense when the term occurs so frequently that it’s unlikely
to differentiate two documents’ relevance (since the term is so common). But, if
you look at the linear representation, there is no dropping off point. Intuitively,
we want to focus more on the discrimination of low df words rather than these
common words. Of course, which one works better still has to be validated by
running experiments on a data set.
Let’s look at the two documents again in Figure 6.11. Without IDF weighting,
we just had bit vectors. With IDF weighting, we now can adjust the TF (term
frequency) weight by multiplying it with the IDF weight. With this scheme, there
is an adjustment by using the IDF value of about which is smaller than the IDF
value of presidential. Thus, the IDF will distinguish these two words based on how
informative they are. Including the IDF weighting causes d3 to be ranked above
d2, since it matched a rare (informative) word, whereas d2 matched a common
(uninformative) word. This shows that the idea of weighting can solve our second
problem. How effective is this model in general when we use this TF-IDF weighting?
Well, let’s take a look at all the documents that we have seen before.
In Figure 6.12, we show all the five documents that we have seen before and their
new scores using TF-IDF weighting. We see the scores for the first four documents
