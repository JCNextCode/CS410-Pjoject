Steps in the K-means clustering algorithm for a small set of data points to be clustered
(shown in (a)). First, three initial (starting) centroids are randomly chosen (shown in
(b)). Then, all the data points are each assigned to one of the three clusters based on
their distances to each centroid; the decision boundaries are shown as lines in (c). The
assignments lead to three tentative clusters, each of which can then be used to compute
a new centroid to better represent the cluster (shown as three stars in new locations in
(d)). The algorithm continues to iterate with the new centroids as the starting centroids
to re-assign all the data points. The new boundaries are shown in (e), which are easily
seen to be already very close to the optimal centroids for generating three clusters from
this data set.
analysis through the PLSA algorithm. For this chapter, it is sufficient to realize that
K-means is a particular manifestation of hard cluster assignment via EM.
Figure 14.4 shows the K-means algorithm in action. Frame (a) shows our initial
setup with the data points to be clustered. Here we visualize the data points with
different shapes to suggest that there are three distinct clusters, corresponding to
three shapes (crosses, circles, and triangles). Frame (b) shows how three random
centroids are chosen (K = 3). In frame (c), the black lines show the partition of
documents in their respective centroid. These lines can be found by first drawing a
line to connect each pair of centroids and then finding the perpendicular bisectors
of the segments connecting two centroids. This step is marked (Ex.) in the pseu-
docode. Then, once the cluster assignments are determined, frame (d) shows how
