another dimension and don’t care so much about value, at least compared to the
top ten group.
These ratios are computed based on the inferred weights from the model. We can
see the average prices of hotels favored by the top ten reviewers are indeed much
cheaper than those that are favored by the bottom ten. This provides some indirect
way of validating the inferred weights. Looking at the average price in these three
cities, you can actually see the top ten group tends to have below average prices,
whereas the bottom half (that cares about aspects like service or room condition)
tend to have hotels that have higher prices than average.
With these results, we can build many interesting applications. For example,
a direct application would be to generate a collective summary for each aspect,
including the positive sand negative sentences about each aspect. This is more
informative than the original review that just has an overall rating and review text.
Figure 18.15 shows some interesting results on analyzing user rating behavior.
What you see is average weights along different dimensions by different groups
of reviewers. On the left side you see the weights of viewers that like the expensive
hotels. They gave the expensive hotels five stars, with heavy aspect weight on service.
That suggests that people like expensive hotels because of good service, which is
not surprising. This is another way to validate the model by the inferred weights.
The five-star ratings on the right side correspond to the reviewers that like the
cheaper hotels. As expected, they put more weight on value. If you look at when
they didn’t like cheaper hotels, you’ll see that they tended to have more weights on
the condition of the room cleanliness. This shows that by using this model, we can
