Figure 14.3
Three different cluster-cluster similarity metrics.
Below, we outline three cluster similarity measures and illustrate them in Fig-
ure 14.3.
Single-link merges the two clusters with the smallest minimum distance. This
results in “looser” clusters, since we only need to find two individually close
elements in each cluster in order to perform the merge.
Complete-link merges the two clusters with the smallest maximum distance be-
tween elements. This results in very “tight” and “compact” clusters since the
cluster diameter is kept small (i.e., the distance between all elements low).
