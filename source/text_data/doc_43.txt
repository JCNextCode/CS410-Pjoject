2.1 Basics of Probability and Statistics

The Kolmogorov axioms describe facts about probability distributions in general
(both discrete and continuous). We discuss them now, since they are a good sanity
check when designing your own models. A valid probability distribution θ with
probability space � must satisfy the following three axioms.
.
Each event has a probability between zero and one:
0 ≤ pθ(ω ∈ �) ≤ 1.
(2.1)
.
An event not in � has probability zero, and the probability of any event
occurring from � is one:
pθ(ω′) = 0, ω′ ̸∈ �
and
pθ(�) = 1.
(2.2)
.
The probability of all (disjoint) events sums to one:
�
ω∈�
pθ(ω) = 1.
(2.3)
Note that, strictly speaking, an event is defined as a subset of the probability
space �, and we say that an event happens if and only if the outcome from a random
experiment (i.e., randomly drawing an outcome from �) is in the corresponding
subset of outcomes defined by the event. Thus, it is easy to understand that the
special event corresponding to the empty subset is an impossible event with a
probability of zero, whereas the special event corresponding to the complete set
� itself always happens and so has a probability of 1.0. As a special case, we can
consider an event space with only those events that each have precisely one element
of outcome, which is exactly what we assumed when talking about a distribution
over all the words. Here each word corresponds to the event defined by the subset
with the word as the only element; clearly, such an event happens if and only if the
outcome is the corresponding word.

For this section, let’s modify our original die rolling example. We will keep the
original distribution as θC, indicating the color probabilities:
