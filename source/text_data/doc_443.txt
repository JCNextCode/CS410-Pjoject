The common theme indicates that “United Nations” is involved in both wars
Collection-speciﬁc themes indicate different roles of “United Nations” in the two wars
Figure 19.6
Sample results of comparing two sets of news articles. (Results were generated using
the method in Zhai et al. [2004], which is a special case of CPLSA)
which are precisely what we hope to discover in contextual text mining. For details
of CPLSA, readers can refer to Mei and Zhai [2006].
We now show some sample results of CPLSA. First, in Figure 19.6, we show re-
sults from comparing two sets of news articles about the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars, respectively, including high probability words in both common topics and
collection-specific topics. In this case, the context is the topic and leads to a parti-
tioning of news articles into two sets corresponding to these two wars, and CPLSA
degenerates to a simpler cross-collection mixture model [Zhai et al. 2004].
We have 30 articles on the Iraq war and 26 articles on the Afghanistan war. Our
goal is to compare the two sets of articles to discover the common topics shared by
the two sets and understand the variations of these topics in each set. The results
in Figure 19.6 show that CPLSA can discover meaningful topics. The first column
(Cluster 1) shows a very meaningful common topic about the United Nations on the
first row, which intuitively makes sense given the topics of these two collections.
Such a topic may not be surprising to people who know the background about these
articles, but the result shows that CPLSA can automatically discover it.
