An example of tasks in natural language understanding.
ligence. In this sense, NLP is “AI complete”, i.e., as difficult as any other difficult
problems in artificial intelligence.
The following are a few examples of specific challenges in natural language
understanding.
Word-level ambiguity.
A word may have multiple syntactic categories and mul-
tiple senses. For example, design can be a noun or a verb (ambiguous POS);
root has multiple meanings even as a noun (ambiguous sense).
Syntactic ambiguity. A phrase or a sentence may have multiple syntactic struc-
tures. For example, natural language processing can have two different inter-
pretations: “processing of natural language” vs. “natural processing of lan-
guage” (ambiguous modification). Another example: A man saw a boy with
a telescope has two distinct syntactic structures, leading to a different result
regarding who had the telescope (ambiguous prepositional phrase (PP) at-
tachment).
Anaphora resolution.
What exactly a pronoun refers to may be unclear. For
example, in John persuaded Bill to buy a TV for himself , does himself refer to
John or Bill?
