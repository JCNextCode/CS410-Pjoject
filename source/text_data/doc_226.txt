that since there are no zero values in the matrix, such iteration is guaranteed to
converge. At that point we will have the PageRank scores for all the pages.
Interestingly, this update formula can be interpreted as propagating scores
across the graph. We can imagine we have values initialized on each of these pages,
and if you look at the equation, we combine the scores of the pages that would lead
to reaching a page. That is, we’ll look at all the pages that are pointing to a page and
combine their scores with the propagated score in order to get the next score for
thecurrentdocument.Werepeatthisforalldocuments, whichtransfersprobability
mass across the network.
In practice, the calculation of the PageRank score is actually quite efficient
because the matrices are sparse—that means that if there isn’t a link into the
current page, we don’t have to worry about it in the calculation. It’s also possible
to normalize the equation, and that will give a somewhat different form, although
the relative ranking of pages will not change. The normalization is to address the
potential problem of zero outlinks. In that case, the probabilities of reaching the
next page from the current page will not sum to 1 because we have lost some
probability mass when we assume that there’s some probability that the surfer will
try to follow links (although in this case there are no links to follow!).
There are many extensions to PageRank. One extension is to do query-specific
PageRank, also called Personalized PageRank. For example, in this topic-specific
PageRank, we can simply assume when the surfer gets bored, they won’t randomly
jump into any page on the web. Instead, they jump to only those pages that are
relevant to the query. For example, if the query is about sports, then we could
assume that when we do random jumping, we randomly jump to a sports page.
By doing this, our PageRank scores align with sports. Therefore, if you know the
current query is about sports, we can use this specialized PageRank score to rank
the results. Clearly, this would be better than using a generic PageRank score for
the entire web.
PageRank is a general algorithm that can be used in many other applications
such as network analysis, particularly in social networks. We can imagine if you
compute a person’s PageRank score on a social network (where a link indicates a
friendship relation), you’ll get some meaningful scores for people.

HITS
We’ve talked about PageRank as a way to capture authority pages. In the beginning
of this section, we also mentioned that hub pages are useful. There is another
algorithm we will discuss called HITS that is designed to compute both these scores
for each page.
