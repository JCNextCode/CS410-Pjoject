20.3 META as a Unified System

The index structure also facilitates the idea mentioned earlier: advanced text
mining techniques are run on a smaller relevant subset of the entire dataset. For
this, we can take the output from searching an inverted index and run (e.g.) topic
modeling algorithms on the relevant documents.
Thus, the analysis operators such as Select and Split take META’s index objects
as input and return objects such as a sequence. The algorithms that run for Select
could be a filter or search engine, and Split could be meta::topics::lda_model
or some other clustering algorithm.
