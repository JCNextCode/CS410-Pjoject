Overview of Text
Data Analysis
In the previous chapters that we grouped under Part II, we have covered techniques
for text data access, which is logically an initial step for processing text data for
the purpose of both significantly reducing the size of the data set to be further
processed (either by humans or machines) and filtering out any obvious noise in the
text data so as to focus on the truly relevant data to a particular application problem.
In Part III of the book, starting from this chapter, we will cover techniques for
further processing relevant text data so as to extract and discover useful actionable
knowledge that can be directly used for decision making or supporting a user’s task.
One difference between Part II and Part III is the extent to which the information
need of a user, or equivalently, a specific application, is emphasized. Specifically,
since the purpose of text data access is, in general, to connect users with the
right information at the right time so that they can further digest and exploit the
relevant text data (with or without the help of additional text analysis techniques),
the concept of information need and the closely related concept of relevance play an
important role in all the techniques covered in Part II. For example, queries play an
essential role in any search engines, and accurate modeling of a user’s interest and
information need plays an equally important role in any recommender systems. In
Part III, however, we generally can assume that the text data to be considered are
all relevant, so we will see that we no longer emphasize the information need so
much, but instead will emphasize the goal toward understand the content of text
in more detail and find any interesting patterns in text data such as topical trends
or sentiment polarity so as to eventually extract and discover actionable knowledge
directly useful for finishing a user task. As such, we will attempt to view the process
of text data analysis as a special case of the general process of data mining, where
users would use various data mining operators to probe and analyze the data in
an interactive manner. Multiple operators may be combined. Specifically, we will
view humans as “subjective sensors” of our world, and text data as data generated
