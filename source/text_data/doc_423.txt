ment weights of the words. Of course, these sentiment weights might be different
for different aspects. For each aspect i we have a set of term sentiment weights for
word w denoted as βi,w.
In the second stage, we assume that the overall rating is simply a weighted
combination of these aspect ratings. We assume we have aspect weights αi(d),
and these will be used to take a weighted average of the aspect ratings ri(d). This
method assumes the overall rating is simply a weighted average of these aspect
ratings, which allows us to predict the overall rating based on the observable word
frequencies.
On the left side of Figure 18.10 is all the observed information, rd (the overall
rating) and ci(w, d). On the right side is all the latent (hidden) information that
we hope to discover. This is a typical case of a generative model where we embed
the interesting latent variables. Then, we set up a generative probability for the
overall rating given the observed words. We can adjust these parameter values to
maximize the conditional probability of the observed rating given the document.
We have seen such cases before in other models such as PLSA, where we predict
topics in text data. Here, we’re predicting the aspect ratings and other parameters.
More formally, the data we are modeling here is a set of review documents with
overall ratings, as shown in Figure 18.11. Each review document is denoted as d
and the overall ratings denoted by rd. We use ci(w, d) to denote the count of word
w in aspect segment i. The model is going to predict the rating based on d, so
we’re interested in the rating regression problem of p(rd | d). This model is set
• Data: a set of review documents with overall ratings: C = {(d, rd)}
 – d is pre-segmented into k aspect segments
 – ci(w, d) = count of word w in aspect segment i (zero if w didn’t occur)
• Model: predict rating based on d: p(rd|d)
Overall rating = weighted average of aspect ratings
Aspect rating = sum of sentiment weights of words in the aspect
