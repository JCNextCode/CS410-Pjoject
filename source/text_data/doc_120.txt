Let k represent df(w); if you plot the IDF function by varying k, then you will see
a curve like the one illustrated in Figure 6.10. In general, you can see it would give
a higher value for a low df , indicating a rare word. You can also see the maximum
value of this function is log(M + 1). The specific function is not as important as the
heuristic it captures: penalizing popular terms. Whether there is a better form of
