assumed to be potentially related to the impact of the event. The results shown
here are the topics discovered from research articles on information retrieval,
particularly SIGIR papers. The topic we are focusing on is about the retrieval models
(shown on the left). The goal is to analyze the impact of two events. One is the
launch of the Text and Retrieval Conference (TREC) around 1992, a major annual
evaluation effort sponsored by the U.S. government, which is known to have made
a huge impact on the topics of research in information retrieval. The other event is
the publication of a seminal paper in 1998 by Ponte and Croft [1998], in which the
language modeling approach to information retrieval was introduced. The paper
is also known to have made a high impact on information retrieval research. To
understand the impact of these two events, we can use time periods before and
after an event as different contexts and apply CPLSA.
The results on the top show that before TREC, the study of retrieval models
was mostly on the vector space model and Boolean models, but after TREC, the
study of retrieval models apparently explored a variety application tasks (e.g., XML
