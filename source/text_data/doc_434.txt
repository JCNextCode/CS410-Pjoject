analysis of all the data, we can generate multiple predictors of the interesting
variables to us. We call these predictors features, and they can further be combined
and put into a predictive model to actually predict the value of any interesting
variable. The prediction results would then allow us to act and change the world.
This is the general process for making a prediction based on any data.
It’s important to emphasize that a human actually plays a very important role in
this process, especially because of the involvement of text data. First, a human user
would be involved in the mining of the data. The user can control the generation
of these features and can even manually create features. Second, humans can
help understand the text data, because text data are created to be consumed by
humans, and humans can consume and interpret text data much more effectively
than a machine. The challenge, of course, is when there is an enormous amount
of text data, since it would not be feasible for humans to read and digest all the
information. Thus, machines must help and that’s why we need to do text data
mining. Sometimes machines can even “see” patterns in data that humans may
not see even if they have the time to read all the data.
Next, humans also must be involved in building, adjusting and testing a predic-
tive model. In particular, we humans will have important domain knowledge about
