2.1 Basics of Probability and Statistics

The numerator p(X = x, Y = y) is the probability of exactly the configuration
we’re looking for (i.e., both x and y have been observed), which is normalized by
p(Y = y), the probability that the condition is true (i.e., y has been observed). Using
this knowledge, we can calculate p(xC = green | xS = circle):
p(xC = green | xS = circle) = p(xC = green, xS = circle)
p(xS = circle)
= 1/6
1/2 = 1

One other important concept to mention is independence. In the previous ex-
amples, the two random variables were dependent, meaning the value of one
will influence the value of the other. Consider another situation where we have
c1, c2 ∼ θC. That is, we draw two colors from the color distribution. Does the knowl-
edge of c1 inform the probability of c2? No, since each draw is done “independently”
of the other. In the case where two random variables X and Y are independent,
p(X, Y) = p(X)p(Y). Can you see why this is the case?
Both conditional and joint probabilities can be used to answer interesting ques-
tions about text. For example, given a document, what is the probability of observ-
ing the word information and retrieval in the same sentence? What is the probability
of observing retrieval if we know information has occurred?
2.1.2
Bayes’ Rule
Bayes’ rule may be derived using the definition of conditional probability:
p(X | Y) = p(X, Y)
p(Y)
and
p(Y | X) = p(Y , X)
p(X) .
Therefore, setting the two joint probabilities equal,
p(X | Y)p(Y) = p(X, Y) = p(Y | X)p(X).
We can simplify them as
p(X | Y) = p(Y | X)p(X)
p(Y)
.
(2.5)
The above formula is known as Bayes’ rule, named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes
(1701–1761). This rule has widespread applications. In this book, you will see heavy
use of this formula in the text categorization chapter as well as the topic analysis
chapter, among others. We will leave it up to the individual chapters to explain their
useofthisruleintheirimplementation.Essentially, though, Bayes’rulecanbeused
to make inference about a hypothesis based on the observed evidence related to the
hypothesis.
