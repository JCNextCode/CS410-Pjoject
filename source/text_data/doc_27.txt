retrieval and text mining to real-world text data and learn how to experiment with
and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. This book
can be used as a textbook for computer science undergraduates and graduates, li-
brary and information scientists, or as a reference book for practitioners working
on relevant application problems in analyzing and managing text data.
1.1
Functions of Text Information Systems
From a userâ€™s perspective, a text information system (TIS) can offer three distinct,
but related capabilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.2.
Information Access.
This capability gives a user access to the useful informa-
tion when the user needs it. With this capability, a TIS can connect the right
information with the right user at the right time. For example, a search en-
gine enables a user to access text information through querying, whereas a
recommender system can push relevant information to a user as new informa-
tion items become available. Since the main purpose of Information Access
is to connect a user with relevant information, a TIS offering this capability

Information access, knowledge acquisition, and text organization are three major
capabilities of a text information system with text organization playing a supporting
role for information access and knowledge acquisition. Knowledge acquisition is also
often referred to as text mining.
