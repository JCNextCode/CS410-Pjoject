Example of query models learned via pseudo-relevance feedback.
mixture model as a single distribution in that we can still ask it to generate words,
and it will still give us a word in a random way (according to the underlying models).
Which word will show up depends on both the topic distribution and background
distribution. In addition, it would also depend on the mixing parameter λ; if λ is
high, it’s going to prefer the background distribution. Conversely, if λ is very small,
we’re going to use only our topic words.
Once we’re thinking this way, we can do exactly the same as what we did before
by using MLE to adjust this model and set the parameters to best explain the data.
The difference, however, is that we are not asking the unknown topic model alone
to explain all the words; rather, we’re going to ask the whole mixture model to
explain the data. As a result, it doesn’t have to assign high probabilities to words like
the, which is exactly what we want. It would then assign high probabilities to other
words that are common in the topic distribution but not having high probability
in the background distribution. As a result, this topic model must assign high
probabilities to the words common in the feedback documents yet not common
across the whole collection.
Mathematically, we have to compute the log likelihood of the feedback docu-
ments F with another parameter λ, which denotes noise in the feedback
documents. We assume it will be fixed to some value. Assuming it’s fixed, then
