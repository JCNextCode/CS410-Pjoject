Information available to the content-based recommender system.
There are some interesting challenges in threshold learning. Figure 11.4 depicts
the type of data that you can collect in the filtering system. We have the scores and
the status of relevance. The first document has a score 36.5 and it’s relevant. The
second one is not relevant. We have many documents for which we don’t know the
status, since their scores are less than θ and are not shown to the user for judging.
Thus, the judged documents are not a random sample; it’s biased or censored
data, which creates some difficulty for learning an optimal θ. Secondly, there are in
general very little labeled data and very few relevant data, which make it challenging
