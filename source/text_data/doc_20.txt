Preface
to thank all the people who have helped with these two MOOCs, especially TAs
Hussein Hazimeh and Alex Morales, and UIUC instruction support staff Jason
Mock, Shannon Bicknell, Katie Woodruff, and Edward Noel Dignan, and the Head
of Computer Science Department, Rob Rutenbar, whose encouragement, support,
and help are all essential for these two MOOCs to happen. The first author also
wants to thank UIUC for allowing him to use the sabbatical leave in Fall 2015 to
work on this book. Special thanks are due to Chase Geigle, co-founder of META. In
addition to all the above, the second author would like to thank Chase Geigle, Jason
Cho, and Urvashi Khandelwal (among many others) for insightful discussion and
encouragement.
Finally, we would like to thank all our family members, particularly our wives,
Mei and Kai, for their love and support. The first author wants to further thank
his brother Chengxing for the constant intellectual stimulation in their regular
research discussions and his parents for cultivating his passion for learning and
sharing knowledge with others.
