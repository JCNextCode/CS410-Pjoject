Joint Analysis of Text
and Structured Data
In this chapter, we discuss techniques for joint analysis of text and structured data,
which not only enriches text analysis, but is often necessary for many prediction
problems involving both structured data and unstructured text data. Due to the
complexity of many of these methods and the limited space, we will only give a brief
introduction to the main ideas and show sample results to provide a sense about
what kind of applications these techniques can support. Details of these techniques
can be found in the references provided at the end of this chapter.

Introduction
In real-world big data applications, we would have both structured data and un-
structured text data available to help us make predictions and support decision
making. It is thus important to analyze both kinds of data jointly, especially when
the goal is to predict some latent real-world variable that is not directly observed
in the data. To illustrate this problem setup and the big picture of data mining in
general, we show the data mining loop in Figure 19.1.
In this figure, we see that there are multiple sensors—including human sen-
sors—to report what we have seen in the real world in the form of data. The data
include both non-text data and text data. Our goal is to see if we can predict some
values of important real world variables that matter to us. For example, we might
be interested in predicting the condition of a bridge, the weather, stock prices, or
presidential election results. We are interested in predicting such variables because
we might want to act on the inferred values or make decisions based on the inferred
values.
How can we get from the data to these predicted values? We’ll first have to do data
mining and analysis of the data. In general, we should try to leverage all the data
that we can collect, and joint mining of non-text and text data is critical. Through
