Text summarization using maximum marginal relevance to select one sentence from
each passage as a summary.
discourse analysis (a subfield of NLP). Discourse analysis deals with sequences of
sentences as opposed to only one sentence.
Now that we have our passages, how can we remove redundancy and increase
diversity in the resulting summarization during step two? The technique maximal
marginal relevance (MMR) reranking can be applied to our problem. Essentially,
this algorithm greedily reranks each sentence in the current passage, outputting
only the top few as a summary. Figure 16.2 shows the output of the algorithm when
we only select one sentence from each passage.
The MMR algorithm is as follows. Assume we are given an original list R and
a profile p to construct the set of selected sentences S (where |S| ≪ |R|). R is a
partitioned chunk of sentences in the document we wish to summarize. The profile
p determines what is exactly meant by “relevance.” Originally, the MMR formula
wasappliedtodocumentsreturnedfromaninformationretrievalsystem(hencethe
term reranking). Documents were selected based on their marginal relevance to a
query (which is our variable p) in addition to non-redundancy to already-selected
documents. Since our task deals with sentence retrieval, p can be a user profile (text
about the user), the entire document itself, or it could even be a query formulated
by the user.
According to marginal relevance, the next sentence si to be added into the
selected list S is defined as
