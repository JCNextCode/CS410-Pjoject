Toward A Unified System
for Text Management
and Analysis
In the previous chapters, we introduced many specific algorithms and techniques
for managing and analyzing text data. These algorithms are currently implemented
in separate toolkits, but from an application perspective, it would be beneficial
to develop a unified system that can support potentially all these algorithms in a
general way so that it can be used in many different applications. In this chapter,
we discuss how we can model these different algorithms as operators in a unified
analysis framework and potentially develop a general system to implement such a
framework.
From a user’s perspective, we distinguished (at a very high level) two related ap-
plication tasks: text data access and text analysis. The goal of text data access is to
enable users to identify and obtain the most useful text data relevant to an appli-
cation problem, which is often achieved through the support of a search engine.
The current search engines primarily support querying, which is, however, only
one way to help users find relevant documents. Browsing is another useful form
of information access where the users can take the initiative to navigate through a
structure into relevant information. The support of browsing is generally achieved
by adding structures to text data by using clustering, categorization, or topic analy-
sis. In addition to supporting querying and browsing, a search engine can also
support recommendation of information, thus providing multi-mode information
access through both pull mode (querying and browsing) and push mode (recom-
mendation).
Since text data are created by humans and often meant to be consumed by
humans—and the current NLP techniques are still not mature enough for comput-
ers to have accurate understanding of text data—it is generally necessary to involve
