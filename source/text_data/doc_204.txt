statistical significance test. The significance test gives us an idea as to how likely a
difference in evaluation scores is due to random chance. This is the reason why we
have to use a lot of queries; the more data points we have, the more confident we
can be in our measure.
Figure 9.8 displays some sample average precision results from system A and
system B in two different experiments. As you can see in the bottom of the figure,
we have the MAP for each system in each experiment. They happen to be identi-
cal in experiment one and two. Yet if you look at the exact average precisions for
different queries, you will realize that in one case you might feel that you can trust
the conclusion here given by the average. In the other case, you might not feel as
confident. Based on only the MAP score, we can easily say that system B is better.
After all, it’s 0.4, which is twice as much as 0.2. Clearly, that’s better performance.
But if you look at these two experiments and look at the detailed results, you will
see that we’ll be more confident to say that in experiment 1 that system B is in
fact better since the average precisions are consistently better than system A’s. In
experiment 2, we’re not sure that system B is better since the scores fluctuate so
wildly.
How can we quantitatively answer this question? This is why we need to do a
statistical significance test. The idea behind these tests is to assess the variance in
averageprecisionscores(oranyotherscore)acrossthesedifferentqueries.Ifthere’s
a big variance, that means that the results could fluctuate according to different
queries, which makes the result unreliable.
