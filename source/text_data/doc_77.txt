META: A Unified Toolkit
for Text Data
Management and
Analysis
This chapter introduces the accompanying software META, a free and open-source
toolkit that can be used to analyze text data. Throughout this book, we give hands-
on exercises with META to practice concepts and explore different text mining
algorithms.
Most of the algorithms and methods discussed in this book can be found in
some form in the META toolkit. If META doesn’t include a technique discussed in
this book, it’s likely that a chapter exercise is to implement this feature yourself! De-
spite being a powerful toolkit, META’s simplicity makes feature additions relatively
straightforward, usually through extending a short class hierarchy.
Configuration files are an integral part of META’s forward-facing infrastructure.
They are designed such that exploratory analysis usually requires no programming
effort from the user. By default, META is packaged with various executables that can
be used to solve a particular task. For example, for a classification experiment the
user would run the following command in their terminal1:
./classify config.toml
This is standard procedure for using the default executables; they take only one
configuration file parameter. The configuration file format is explained in detail
later in this chapter, but essentially it allows the user to select a dataset, a way
1. Running the default classification experiment requires a dataset to operate on. The 20news-
groups dataset is specified in the default META config file and can be downloaded here: https://
meta-toolkit.org/data/20newsgroups.tar.gz. Place it in the meta/data/ directory.
