Figure 18.15
Analysis of reviewer preferences. (Based on results from Wang et al. [2010])
infer some information that’s very hard to obtain even if you read all the reviews.
This is a case where text mining algorithms can go beyond what humans can do,
to discover interesting patterns in the data. We can compare different hotels by
comparing the opinions from different consumer groups in different locations. Of
course, the model is quite general, so it can be applied to any reviews with an overall
ratings.
Finally, the results of applying this model for personalized ranking or recom-
mendation of entities are shown in Figure 18.16. Because we can infer the reviewers’
weights on different dimensions, we can allow a user to indicate what they actu-
ally care about. For example, we have a query here that shows 90% of the weight
should be on value and 10% on others. That is, this user just cares about getting a
cheap hotel—an emphasis on the value dimension. With this model, we can find
the reviewers whose weights are similar to the query user’s. Then, we can use those
reviewers to recommend hotels; this is what we call personalized or query specific
recommendation. The non-personalized recommendations are shown on the top,
and you can see the top results generally have much higher price than the bottom
group. That’s because the reviewers on the bottom cared more about the value. This
shows that by doing text mining we can better understand and serve the users.
To summarize our discussion, sentiment analysis is an important topic with
many applications. Text sentiment analysis can be readily done by using just text
categorization, but standard techniques tend to be insufficient so we need to have
an enriched feature representation. We also need to consider the order of the senti-
ment categories if there are more than two; this is where our discussion on ordinal
regression comes into play. We have also shown that generative models are pow-
