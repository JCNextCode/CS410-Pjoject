Overview of Text Data Access
ad hoc retrieval is much harder, as we do not have much feedback information
from a user (i.e., little training data for a particular query). Due to the availability of
training data, the problem of filtering or recommendation can usually be solved by
using supervised machine learning techniques, which are covered well in many ex-
isting books. Thus, we will cover ad hoc retrieval in much more detail than filtering
and recommendation.

Multimode Interactive Access
Ideally, the system should provide support for users to have multimode interactive
access to relevant text data so that the push and pull modes are integrated in
the same information access environment, and querying and browsing are also
seamlessly integrated to provide maximum flexibility to users and allow them to
query and browse at will.
In Figure 5.2, we show a snapshot of a prototype system (http://timan.cs.uiuc
.edu/proj/sosurf/) where a topic map automatically constructed based on a set of
queries collected in a commercial search engine has been added to a regular search
