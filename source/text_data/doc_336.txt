Text Categorization
15.4. In text categorization, there are often thousands if not millions of features.
This makes it very likely to be able to create a hyperplane separating class objects
plotted in this high-dimensional space. Based on this information, make a sugges-
tion for a default classifier to use in text categorization and explain your reasoning.
15.5. In an application setting, you must choose between using Naive Bayes or k-
NN in order to do classification on text documents. Your application demands a
very high performance and needs to classify documents very quickly. Explain your
choice of classifier in this setting.
15.6. Give one similarity and one difference between k-NN and Naive Bayes.
15.7. Why is Naive Bayes “naive”, and why is “Bayes” in the name?
15.8. Say we have a dataset and a classifier. We evaluate the classifier with 5-fold
cross validation and 10-fold cross validation. Which do you think gives a higher
accuracy? Why?
15.9. What is a difference between text categorization evaluation and information
retrieval evaluation?
15.10. How can we determine if we have “enough” training data for a classifier?
Make an argument using a plot, where the x axis is training data size and the y axis
is classification accuracy on unseen test data.
15.11. Explain how to read a confusion matrix in order to determine two classes
that are often mistaken for each other by the classifier.
15.12. Can a confusion matrix give us any clue to class imbalances? Explain.
