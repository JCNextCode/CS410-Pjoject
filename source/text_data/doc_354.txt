some specific examples. So now let’s examine the simple approach we have been
discussing with a sample document in Figure 17.6.
Here we have a text document that’s about an NBA basketball game. In terms of
the content, it’s about sports, but if we simply count these words that represent our
topics, we will find that the word sports actually did not occur in the article, even
though the content is about sports. Since the count of sports is zero, the coverage of
sports would be estimated as zero. We may note that the term science also did not
occur in the document, and so its estimate is also zero, which is intuitively what we
want since the document is not about science. However, giving a zero probability to
sports certainly is a problem because we know the content is about sports. What’s
worse, the term travel actually occurred in the document, so when we estimate
