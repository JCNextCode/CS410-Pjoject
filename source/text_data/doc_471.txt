Example of combination of topic selection, comparison, and interpretation.
combination of multiple topic selections followed by a comparison operator, which
would then be followed by an Interpret operator.
In Figure 20.6, we show another example of combination of a Split operator
followed by a comparison operator, which would then be followed by an Interpret
operator. It is easy to imagine that there are many other ways to combine these
operators.
