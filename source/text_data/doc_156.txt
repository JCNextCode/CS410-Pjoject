Illustration of Rocchio Feedback: adjusting weights in the query vector to move it closer
to a cluster of relevant documents.
all the top-ranked documents will be positive, and this is the motivation behind
feedback in the first place. Our goal is to move the query vector to some position to
improve the retrieval accuracy, shifting the dotted circle of similarity. By looking at
this diagram, we see that we should move the query vector so that the dotted circle
encompasses more + documents than − documents. This is the basic idea behind
Rocchio feedback.
Geometrically, we’re talking about moving a vector closer to some vectors and
away from other vectors. Algebraically, it means we have the following formula
(using the arrow vector notation for clarity):
⃗qm = α . ⃗q +
β
|Dr|
. �
⃗dj∈Dr
⃗dj −
γ
|Dn|
. �
⃗dj∈Dn
⃗dj ,
(7.1)
where ⃗q is the original query vector that is transformed into ⃗qm, the modified (i.e.,
expanded) vector. Dr is the set of relevant feedback documents and Dn is the set of
non-relevant feedback documents. Additionally, we have the parameters α, β, and
γ which are weights that control the amount of movement of the original vector.
In terms of movement, we see that the terms in the original query are boosted by a
factor of α, and terms from positive documents are boosted by a factor of β, while
terms from negative documents are shrunk by a factor of γ .
Another interpretation of the second term (the sum over positive documents)
is the centroid vector of relevant feedback documents while the third term is the
centroid vector of the negative feedback documents. In this sense, we shift the
original query towards the relevant centroid and away from the negative centroid.
Thus, the average over these two terms computes one dimension’s weight in the
centroid of these vectors.
