META: A Unified Toolkit for Text Data Management and Analysis
[[analyzers.filter]]
type = "lowercase"
[[analyzers.filter]]
type = "length"
min = 2
max = 35
META provides many different classes to support building filter chains. Please
look at the API documentation5 for more information. In particular, the analyz-
ers::tokenizers namespace and the analyzers::filters namespace should
give a good idea of the capabilities. The static public attribute id for a given class
is the string needed for the “type” in the configuration file.

Related Toolkits
Existing toolkits supporting text management and analysis tend to fall into two
categories. The first is search engine toolkits, which are especially suitable for
building a search engine application, but tend to have limited support for text
analysis/mining functions. Examples include the following.
Lucene.
https://lucene.apache.org/
Terrier. http://terrier.org/
Indri/Lemur. http://www.lemurproject.org/
The second is text mining or general data mining and machine learning toolkits,
which tend to selectively support some text analysis functions, but generally do not
support search capability. Examples include the following.
Weka. http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
LIBSVM.
