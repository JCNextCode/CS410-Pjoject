So let’s look at these results again in the second case. In Figure 9.9, we show
two different ways to compare them. One is a sign test. If system B is better than
system A, then we have a plus sign. If system A is better, we have a minus sign. Using
this, we have four cases where system B is better and three cases where system A is
better. Intuitively, these results appear random. If you flip seven coins, using plus
to denote heads and minus to denote tails, then these could easily be the results of
just randomly flipping the seven coins. The fact that the average is larger doesn’t
tell us anything! This intuition can be quantified by the concept of a p value. A p
value is the probability that this result is in fact from random fluctuation. In this
case, the probability is one; it means it surely is a random fluctuation.
There are many different significance tests that we can use to quantify the
likelihood that the observed difference in the results is simply due to random
fluctuations. A particularly interesting test is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. It’s
a nonparametric test, and we not only look at the signs, but also consider the
magnitude of the difference in scores. Another is the (parametric) t-test where a

our example case: the outcome is very likely to be random. For further study on this
and other statistical significance tests, we suggest the reader start with Smucker
et al. [2007].
To illustrate the concept of p-values, consider the distribution in Figure 9.10.
This is a normal distribution, with a mean of zero in the center. Say we started with
the assumption that there’s no difference between the two systems. But, we assume
that because of random fluctuations depending on the queries we might observe a
difference; thus, the actual difference might be on the left side or right side. This
