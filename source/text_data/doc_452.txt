Figure 19.13
Sample results of NetPLSA (in comparison to PLSA). (Based on results from Mei et al.
[2008])
(DM), machine learning (ML), and World Wide Web (Web). The data set has been
constructed by pooling together papers from these research communities, and
our goal is to see if NetPLSA can more successfully learn topics well aligned to
the communities than the standard PLSA. The results in Figure 19.12 show that
PLSA is unable to generate the four communities that correspond to our intuition.
The reason was because they are all mixed together and there are many words that
are shared by these communities, and the co-occurrence statistics in the data are
insufficient for separating them.
In contrast, the results of NetPLSA, shown in Figure 19.13, are much more
meaningful, and the four topics correspond well to the four communities that we
intend to discover from the data set. Indeed, it is very easy to label them with the
four communities as shown in the table. The reason why NetPLSA can separate
these communities well and discover more meaningful topics is because of the
influence of the network context. Since our network is the collaboration network
of authors, when we impose the preference for two nodes connected in the network
to have similar topics, the model would further tune the discovered topics to
better reflect the topics worked on by authors involved in the same collaboration
network. As a result, the topics would be more coherent and also better correspond
to the communities (represented by subnetworks of collaboration). These results
are also useful for characterizing the content associated with each subnetwork of
collaboration.
Taking a more general view of text mining in the context of networks, we can
treat text data as living in a rich information network environment. That is, we can
