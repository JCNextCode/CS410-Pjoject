Recommender Systems
related queries as the initial user profile. Shuffle document IDs and examine them
sequentially to simulate a data stream.
11.6. We described a linear utility function U for scoring the usefulness of the
filtering system’s output. Give an example of a nonlinear utility function. How does
this compare to the version introduced in this chapter?
11.7. In our description of beta-gamma thresholding, we showed the user a docu-
ment if score(d) > θ. Can you think of an alternate scoring strategy? Your strategy
may include additional features about the document or user if they are available.
If possible, evaluate your alternate scoring function in META.
11.8. Given n users and m objects, determine the running time of recommending
one item to each user using collaborative filtering. Keep in mind the running time
of a particular similarity algorithm—first, assume we are using cosine similarity.
Would using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient instead change the running time?
11.9. As a method to improve the running time of collaborative filtering, we can
consider only the top-k most active users, where k ≪ n. An active user is one that
has given a large amount of ratings. What is a potential problem with this method?
11.10. Imagine we run a collaborative filtering system on a database of movies.
One movie producer creates many accounts on the collaborative filtering system
and only gives high ratings to movies produced by their own company and low
ratings to all others. Is the collaborative filtering system described in this chapter
susceptible to such spam? If so, brainstorm some anti-spamming measures.
11.11. A collaborative filtering system treats each item independently, even if they
are almost identical. For example, movies in a trilogy would be treated separately.
Give an example where this is desired and give an example where this is proble-
mental.
11.12. What steps need to be taken when new elements are added to the collab-
orative filtering dataset (e.g., new books are released)? Do we have the same cold
start problem as before?
11.13. Is there some relation of RMSE and MAE to L1 and L2 error? Recall that L1
error is defined as
n
�
i=1
|yi − f (xi)|
