Running the HITS algorithm on a small graph.
Authority pages capture the intuition of widely-cited pages. Hub pages are those
that point to good, authority pages, or contain some collection of knowledge in the
form of links. The main idea of the HITS algorithm is a reinforcement mechanism
to help improve the scoring for both hubs and authorities. It will assume that good
authorities are cited by good hubs. That means if you’re cited by many pages with
good hub scores, then that increases your authority score. Similarly, good hubs are
those that point to good authorities. So if you are pointing to many good authority
pages, then your hub score would be increased. Like PageRank, HITS is also quite
general and has many applications in graph and network analysis. Briefly, we’ll
describe how it works.
Figure 10.8 shows the following. First, we construct the adjacency matrix A; it
contains a 1 at position Aij if di links to dj and a zero otherwise. We define the hub
score of a page h(di) as a sum of the authority scores of all the pages that it points
to. In the second equation, we define the authority score of a page a(di) as a sum
of the hub scores of all pages that point to it. This forms an iterative reinforcement
mechanism.
These two equations can be also written in matrix form. The hub vector is equal
to the product of the adjacency matrix and the authority vector. Similarly, the
second equation can be written as the authority vector is equal to the product of
AT multiplied by the hub vector. These are just different ways of expressing these
equations. What’s interesting is that if you look at the matrix forms, you can plug
the authority equation into the first one. That is, you can actually eliminate the
authority vector completely, and you get the equation of only hub scores. We can
