An example of a parse tree.
tree are the words in the sentence, and the preterminals (the direct parents of the
leaves) are part-of-speech tags.
Some common features from a parse tree are production rules such as S â†’
NP V P, tree depth, and structural tree features. Syntactic categories (node labels)
alone can also be used.
The following command runs the parser on each sentence in the input file:
./profile config.toml two-cities.txt --parse
Like POS-tagging, the parsing may also take a minute or two to complete.
4.5. Frequency Analysis.
Perhaps the most common text-processing technique is
frequency counting. This simply counts how many times each unique word appears
in a document (or corpus). Viewing a descending list of words sorted by frequency
can give you an idea of what the document is about. Intuitively, similar documents
should have some of the same high-frequency words . . . not including stop words.
Instead of single words, we can also look at strings of n words, called n-grams.
Consider this sentence: I took a vacation to go to a beach.
1-grams (unigrams):
{I : 1, took : 1, a : 2, vacation : 1, to : 2, go : 1, beach : 1}
2-grams (bigrams):
{I took : 1, took a : 1, a vacation : 1, vacation to : 1,
to go : 1, go to : 1, to a : 1, a beach : 1}
