ELIZA : In what way?
Person: They’re always bugging us about something or other.
ELIZA: Can you think of a specific example?
Person: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
ELIZA: Your boyfriend made you come here?
Person: He says I’m depressed much of the time.
ELIZA: I am sorry to hear that you are depressed.
Person: It’s true. I am unhappy.
ELIZA: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?
Person: I need some help, that much seems certain.
ELIZA: What would it mean to you if you got some help?
Person: Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.
ELIZA: Tell me more about your family
On the surface, the dialogue appears to be quite natural, and indeed, such a
dialogue might be useful to engage a depressed patient in a conversation. However,
the system does not really understand the language, and solely relies on heuristic
rules like the following to keep the dialogue going:
I remember X → Do you often think of X?
always → Can you think of a specific example?
Such rules enable the system to directly perform the task, i.e., making a conver-
sation, without necessarily trying to understand the real meaning of words and
determining the meaning of the entire sentence.
Such a pattern-based way of solving a problem has turned out to be quite pow-
erful. Indeed, modern machine learning approaches to natural language under-
standing are essentially based on this and in many ways are similar to the Eliza
system, but with two important differences. The first is that the rules in a machine
learning system would not be exact or strict; instead, they tend to be stochastic, and
the probabilities of choosing which rule would be empirically set based on a train-
ing data set where the expected behavior of a function to be computed is known.
Second, instead of having human to supply rules, the “soft” rules may be learned
