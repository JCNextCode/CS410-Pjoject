The decision process with ordinal logistic regression.
This score will then be compared with a set of trained α values to see which range
the score is in. Then, using the range, we can decide which rating the object should
receive.

Latent Aspect Rating Analysis
In this section, we’re going to continue discussing opinion mining and senti-
ment analysis. In particular, we’re going to introduce Latent Aspect Rating Analysis
(LARA) which allows us to perform detailed analysis of reviews with overall ratings.
Figure 18.9 shows two hotel reviews. Both reviewers are given five stars. If you
just look at the overall score, it’s not very clear whether the hotel is good for its
locationorforitsservice.It’salsounclearspecificallywhyareviewerlikedthishotel.
What we want to do is to decompose this overall rating into ratings on different
aspects such as value, room, location, and service. If we can decompose the overall
ratings into ratings on these different aspects, we can obtain a much more detailed
understanding of the reviewers’ opinions about the hotel. This would also allow us
to rank hotels along different dimensions such as value or room quality.
Using this knowledge, we can better understand how the reviewers view this
hotel from their own perspective. Not only do we want to infer these aspect ratings,
we also want to infer the aspect weights. That is, some reviewers may care more
about value as opposed to the service. Such a case is what’s shown on the left for
the weight distribution, where you can see most weight is placed on value. Clearly,
different users place priority on different rating aspects. For example, imagine a
