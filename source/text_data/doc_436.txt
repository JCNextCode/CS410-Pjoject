Text-Based Prediction
How can we generate effective predictors from text?

with the specific prediction problem, and is thus inevitably application-specific.
However, there are some generic features we can often start with (like n-grams
or topics) as discussed in some previous chapters. Supervised learning methods
can be used to learn what features are most effective. The second question has
been addressed to some extent in the previous chapters of the book since many
techniques that we have introduced can be potentially used to obtain features
from text data. For example, topic mining can be very useful to generate topic-
based indicators or predictors that can be further fed into a predictive model.
Such topic-based features can be mixed with word-based features to enrich the
feature representation. Sizes of a certain cluster of terms or cluster of documents
may also be potential features. A set of terms with paradigmatic relations may be
a better indicator than any single term, and sentiment tags that we may be able
to generate based on text data are yet another kind of useful feature for some
prediction problems.
What has not been discussed is how we can jointly mine text and non-text data
together to discover interesting knowledge that could not be otherwise discovered
by using either one alone. This interaction is the topic of the chapter.
The benefit of joint analysis of text and non-text data can be seen from two differ-
ent perspectives. First, non-text data can enrich text analysis. Specifically, non-text
data can often provide a context for mining text data and thus enable us to partition
