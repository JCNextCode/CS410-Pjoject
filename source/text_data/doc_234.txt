On the top of Figure 10.10 there are different kinds of users. On the left side,
there are different types of data or information, and on the bottom, there are
different service functions. Now imagine you can connect all these in different
ways. For example, if you connect everyone with web pages, and support search and
browsing, you get web search. If we connect university employees with organization
documents or enterprise documents and support the search and browsing, we get
enterprise search.
We could connect scientists with literature information to provide all kinds of
services including search, browsing, alert to new relevant documents, mining or
analyzing research trends, or task and decision support. For example, we might be
able to provide support for automatically generating a related works section for a
research paper; this would be closer to task support. Then, we can imagine this
intelligent information system would be a type of literature assistant.
If we connect online shoppers with blog articles or product reviews, then we can
