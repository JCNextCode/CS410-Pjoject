Chapter 7
Feedback
7.12. In the feedback methods we discussed in this chapter, we assumed we only
had sets of relevant and non-relevant documents. In reality, we actually have two
ranked lists of relevant and non-relevant documents. How can we take advantage
of these ranked lists for feedback? In other words, how can we treat feedback
documents differently depending on how similar they are to the original query?
Consider the vector space model, the query likelihood model, or both.
7.13. In a real search system, storing modified query vectors for all observed
queries will take up a large amount of space. How could you optimize the amount
of space required? What kind of solutions provide a tradeoff between space and
query time? How about an online system that benefits the majority of users or the
majority of queries?
