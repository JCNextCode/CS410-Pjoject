campaign
“presidential”
If the user is thinking of this doc,
how likely would she pose this query?
p(q = “presidential campaign”|d =
)
… news of presidential
campaign … presidential
candidate …
“presidential”

Generating a query by sampling words from a document.
This probability should be interpreted as the probability that a user who likes doc-
ument d would pose query q. Now the question, of course, is how do we compute
this conditional probability? We will discuss this in detail in the next section.
6.4.1
The Query Likelihood Retrieval Model
In the query likelihood retrieval model, we quantify how likely a user would pose a
particular query in order to find a particular document.
Figure 6.20 shows how the query likelihood model assumes a user imagines
some ideal document and generates a query based on that ideal document’s con-
tent. In this example, the ideal document is about “presidential campaign news.”
Under this model, the user would use this ideal document as a basis to compose
a query to try and retrieve a desired document. More concretely, we assume that
the query is generated by sampling words from the document. For example, a user
might pick a word like presidential from this imaginary document, and then use
this as a query word. The user would then pick another word like campaign, and
that would be the second query word. Of course, this is only an assumption we
have made about how users pose queries. Whether a user actually follows this pro-
cess is a different question. Importantly, though, this assumption has allowed us
to formally characterize the conditional probability of a query given a document
without relying on the big table that was presented earlier. This is why we can use
this fundamental idea to further derive retrieval functions that we can implement
with language models.
