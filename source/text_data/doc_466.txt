Toward A Unified System for Text Management and Analysis
humans in any text data application. In this sense, a text data management and
analysis system should serve as an intelligent assistant for users requiring informa-
tion, or the analysts that would like to leverage text data for intelligence to optimize
decision making.
Thus, it is quite important to optimize the collaboration of humans and ma-
chines. This means that we should take advantage of a computer’s ability to handle
large amounts of text data while exploiting humans’ expertise in detailed language
understanding and assessing knowledge for decision making. Supporting an inter-
active process to engage users in a “dialogue” with the intelligent text information
system is generally beneficial as it enables the users and system to have more com-
munications between each other and assist each other to work together toward
accomplishing the common goal of solving a user’s problem by analyzing text data.
Looking at the problem in this way, we can easily see the possibility of dividing
the work between a human user and a machine in different ways. At one extreme,
we would mostly rely on users to complete access and analysis tasks, and have the
computer to do only the support that the computer can robustly provide. This is
the current scenario when people use a search engine to perform mostly manual
text mining, as shown in Figure 20.1. For example, we can all use a web search
engine to help us get access to the most relevant information buried in the large
amounts of text data on the Web, and then read all the relevant information, which
is essentially manual text mining and analysis. In such a scenario, the search engine
