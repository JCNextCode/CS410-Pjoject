Figure 19.3
Context leads to partitioning of text data.
As a specific example, we show how some context variables enable partition-
ing of research papers in many different ways in Figure 19.3. The horizontal di-
mension of the figure shows different conference venues where the papers are
published, and the vertical dimension shows the time of a publication. We can
treat each paper as a separate unit; in this case, a paper ID serves as the con-
text and each paper has its own context. We can treat all the papers published
in 1998 as one group, and partition papers by the year due to the availability of
time as a non-text variable. Such a partitioning would allow us to compare top-
ics in different years. Similarly, we can partition the data based on the venues;
we can group all the papers published in SIGIR and compare them with those
published in KDD or ACL. This comparison is enabled by the availability of the
non-text variable of the conference venue. Furthermore, we can also partition the
data to obtain the papers written by authors in the U.S. by using additional con-
text of the authors. Such a contextual view of the data would allow us to com-
pare papers written by American authors with those written by authors in other
countries.
