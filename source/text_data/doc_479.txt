How the α and β parameters affect the shape of the Beta distribution. Shown from left
to right are the unimodal Beta (α, β > 1), the sparse Beta (α, β < 1), and the symmetric
Beta (α = β).

Pseudo Counts, Smoothing, and Setting Hyperparameters
How can we interpret our result for a Bayesian estimate of binomial parameters?
E[θ | D] =
H + α
H + T + α + β
(A.9)
We know that the Beta and binomial distributions are similar. In fact, their re-
lationship can be stated as the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior of the binomial
distribution. All distributions in the exponential family have conjugate priors. The
relationship is such: given a likelihood from an X distribution, picking the conju-
gate prior distribution of X (say it’s Y) will ensure that the posterior distribution is
also a Y distribution.
For our coin flipping case, the likelihood was a binomial distribution. We picked
our prior to be the Beta distribution, and our posterior distribution ended up also
being a Beta distribution—this is because we picked the conjugate prior!
In any event, the whole reasoning behind having a prior is so we can include
some reasonable guess for the parameters before we even see any data. For coin
flipping, we might want to assume a “fair” coin. If for some reason we believe that
the coin may be biased, we can incorporate that knowledge as well.
If we look at the estimate for θ, we can imagine how setting our hyperparameters
can influence our prediction. Recall that θ is the probability of heads; if we want
to make our estimate biased toward more heads, we can set an α > β since this
increases θ. This agrees with the mean of the prior as well:
α
α+β . Setting the mean
equal to 0.8 means that our prior belief is a coin that lands heads 80% of the time.
