Chapter 8
Search Engine Implementation
8.7. What type of integer compression is supported in META? Write one of the
implementations discussed in this chapter that does not exist in the toolkit.
8.8. Which type of scoring (document- vs. term-at-a-time) does META use? Hint:
see the file meta/src/index/ranker/ranker.cpp.
8.9. Implement the other type of query scoring and compare its runtime to the
existing method in META.
8.10. META has an implementation of a DBLRU cache. Experiment with the cache
size parameter and plot the retrieval speed against different cache sizes while
holding any other variables constant.
8.11. META does not currently have an implementation of an LRU cache as dis-
cussed in this chapter. Can you write one and compare its performance to the
DBLRU cache in terms of memory usage and speed?
