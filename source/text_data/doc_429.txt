information and sentiment by weighting words in the model. For product reviews,
the opinion holder and the opinion target are clear, making them easy to analyze.
There, of course, we have many practical applications. Opinion mining from news
and social media is also important, but that’s more difficult than analyzing review
data mainly because the opinion holders and opinion targets are not clearly de-
fined. This challenge calls for more advanced natural language processing.
For future reading on topics presented in this chapter, we suggest [Pang and Lee

Evaluation of Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis
In this chapter we investigated opinion mining and sentiment analysis from the
viewpoint of both classification (or regression) and topic analysis. Thus, evaluation
from these perspectives will be similar to those discussed in Chapter 15 (catego-
rization) and Chapter 17 (topic analysis).
From a classification viewpoint, we can use a dataset with documents labeled
as positive or negative, or as ratings on a numerical scale as described in this
chapter. This then becomes the standard machine learning testing setup where
we can use techniques such as cross-fold validation to determine the effectiveness
of our method. Additionally, feature selection can show which features are the most
