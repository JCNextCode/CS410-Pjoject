Extending a search engine to create an analysis engine that directly supports a user’s
task.
plays two important roles. For one, it enables a user to quickly identify the most
relevant text data, which is often what we really need for solving a problem, thus
avoiding dealing with a huge amount of non-relevant text data. Such a strategy
of data selection (reduction) is logically the very first step we should take when
tackling the scalability problem caused by the size of data. Secondly, it provides
knowledge provenance in the sense that it allows a user to easily navigate into any
source to examine its reliability in depth. At this extreme, the computer has done
the minimum, if anything at all, to support text analysis. However, the system (i.e.,
search engine) is very robust and can handle large amounts of data quickly.
At the other extreme, the system can attempt to provide task support directly to
the user so as to minimize the user’s effort, as illustrated in Figure 20.2.
Providing such a support for arbitrary tasks or even a large class of tasks is im-
possible due to the inability of computers to understand natural language and the
lack of knowledge about specific task requirements. As a result, we can only build
very specialized predictive models for a particular problem, where the features gen-
erally have to be designed by humans. This kind of system may provide maximum
support for a decision task, but the function of the system is inevitably restricted
to a specific task. Since predictive modeling generally requires the use of machine
learning techniques and combining features extracted from both text and non-text
