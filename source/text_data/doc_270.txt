Chapter 12
Overview of Text Data Analysis
look at clustering text objects (Chapter 14). This groups similar objects together,
allowing exploratory analysis, among many other applications. Chapter 15 covers
text categorization, which expands on the introduction to machine learning given
inChapter2.Wealsoexploredifferentmethodsoftextsummarization(Chapter16).
Next, we’ll discuss topic mining and analysis (Chapter 17). This is only one way to
analyze content of text, but it’s very useful and used in a wide array of applica-
tions. Then, we will introduce opinion mining and sentiment analysis. This can be
regarded as one example of mining knowledge about the observer, and will be cov-
ered in Chapter 18. Finally, we will briefly discuss text-based prediction problems
where we try to predict some real-world variable based on text data and present a
number of cutting-edge research results on how to perform joint analysis of text
and non-text data (Chapter 19).
