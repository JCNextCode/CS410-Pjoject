Extractive Text Summarization
Information retrieval-based techniques use the notion of sentence vectors and
similarity functions in order to create a summarization text. A sentence vector is
equivalent in structure to a document vector, albeit based on a smaller number of
words. Below, we will outline a basic information retrieval-based summarization
system.
1. Split the document to be summarized into sections or passages.
2. For each passage, “compress” its sentences into a smaller number of relevant
(yet not redundant) sentences.
This strategy retains coherency since the sentences in the summary are mostly
in the same order as they were in the original document.
Step one is portrayed in Figure 16.1. The sentences in the document are traversed
inorderandanormalized, symmetricsimilaritymeasure(seeChapter14)isapplied
on adjacent pairs of sentences. The plot on the right-hand side of the figure shows
the change in similarity between the sentences. We can inspect these changes to
segment the document into passages when the similarity is low, i.e., a shift in topic
occurs. An alternative approach to this segmentation is to simply use paragraphs
if the document being operated on contains that information, although most of
the time this is not the case. This rudimentary partitioning strategy is a task in
