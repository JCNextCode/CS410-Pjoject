Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis
up as follows. rd is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean that is
a weighted average of the aspect ratings ri(d) and variance δ2. Of course, this is just
our assumption. As always, when we make this assumption, we have a formal way
to model the problem and that allows us to compute the interesting quantities—in
this case, the aspect ratings and the aspect weights.
Each aspect rating ri(d) is assumed to be a sum of sentiment weights of words
in aspect i. The vector of weights α for the aspects in the overall rating is it-
self drawn from another multivariate Gaussian distribution, α(d) ∼ N (μ, �). This
means when we generate our overall rating, we’re going to first draw a set of α val-
ues from this multivariate Gaussian prior distribution. Once we get these α values,
we’re going to compute the weighted average of aspect ratings as the mean of the
normal distribution to generate the overall rating rd. Note that β is indexed by both
i and w. That gives us a way to model different aspect segments of the same word,
since the same word might have positive sentiment for one aspect and negative for
another.
How can we estimate all these parameters? Let’s collectively denote them as
� = (βi,w, μ, �, δ2). As usual, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate which
yields parameters that maximize observed ratings conditioned on their respective
reviews, as shown in Figure 18.12.
Once we estimate the parameters, we can easily compute the aspect rating for a
particular aspect by taking all counts of the words that occurred in segment i and
multiplying them by βi,w, summing over all words. The sum would be zero for words
that do not occur, so we can simply take the sum of all the words in the vocabulary.
