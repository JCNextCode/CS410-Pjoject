System Architecture
In general, we can envision a high-level architecture of a unified system for sup-
porting text management and analysis, as shown in Figure 20.7, where multiple
levels of services are provided to users, including a preprocessing step of natural
language processing, a low-level service for multi-mode text data access, which in-
cludes querying, browsing, and recommendation, a medium-level service for text
data analysis, which includes general analysis operators that can be combined
with each other, and high-level application support, which includes support of
application-specific user tasks. It is important that a user has access to all these lev-
els via a unified interaction interface where the user also has access to a working
space that is personalized according to a specific user and a specific application
task. In this figure, we also show the availability of the non-textual data, which
would generally need a database system to manage it and serve some other mod-
ules such as text analysis (in this case, non-text data can be used as context for
analyzing text data). Finally, we see that we can often further apply general data
mining algorithms such as EM and predictive modeling to process the results that
our analysts have obtained.
As an example, consider a news mining application. If a user performs a keyword
search, a large number of documents containing matching text may be returned.
If we run a topic analysis on the set of returned articles, we can enable browsing
the results to allow the user to more efficiently sift through the data. If the user
