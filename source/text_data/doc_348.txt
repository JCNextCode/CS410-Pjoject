Text Summarization
16.9. Create some simple post-processing rules for natural language generation
realization. The examples we gave in the text were sentence joining and pronoun
insertion. What else can you think of?
16.10. Explain how we can combine text summarization and topic modeling to
create a powerful exploratory text mining application.
16.11. What can we accomplish by interpolating a language model distribution
for an abstractive summarizer with another probability distribution, perhaps from
existing summaries?
