Word Association Mining
feature vectors for each term ID. Then, given a query term, return the most similar
terms.
13.6. Outline a method to group together groups of words (i.e., more than two)
that share similar meaning. For example, plane, car, and train may all be related.
13.7. Outline a method to determine synonyms based on search engine logs. That
is, you are given many queries, and for each query is a list of clicked (assumed
relevant) documents.
13.8. Outline a method to disambiguate homographs (two words that are spelled
the same) based on search engine logs. For example, how can we distinguish a
financial institution bank and a river bank based on these logs?
13.9. In what scenario (if any) is word association mining a generalization of an
n-gram language model?
13.10. Depending on the context size, we get many different types of semantic
meanings from word associations. Give two extremes of the types of relations we
get when the context is very large and when it is very small.
13.11. Is it possible to adjust the word association mining algorithms to find
antonyms instead of synonyms? If so, explain how; if not, explain why it is not
possible. That is, we would like to assign a high score to the pair (hot, cold) since
they are opposites and a low score to (freezing, cold) since they are synonyms.
