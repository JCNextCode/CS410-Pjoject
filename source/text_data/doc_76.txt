Text Data Understanding
3.6. Suppose we appended a duplicate copy of the topic collection to itself and
re-estimated a maximum likelihood language model. Would θ change?
3.7. A unigram language model as defined in this chapter can take a sequence of
words as input and output its probability. Explain how this calculation has strong
independence assumptions.
3.8. Given a unigram language model θ estimated from this book, and two doc-
uments d1 = information retrieval and d2 = retrieval information, then is
p(d1 | θ) > p(d2 | θ)? Explain.
3.9. An n-gram language model records sequences of n words. How does the num-
ber of possible parameters change if we decided to use a 2-gram (bigram) language
model instead of a unigram language model? How about a 3-gram (trigram) model?
Give your answer in terms of V , the unigram vocabulary size.
3.10. Using your favorite programming language, estimate a unigram language
model using maximum likelihood. Do this by reading a single text file and delim-
iting words by whitespace.
3.11. Sort the words by their probabilities from the previous exercise. If you used
a different text file, how would your sorted list be different? How would it be the
same?
