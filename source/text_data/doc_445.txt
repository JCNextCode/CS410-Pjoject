Temporal trends of topics discovered from blog articles about Hurricane Katrina.
(Based on results from Mei et al. [2006a])
and their dynamics over time, but also enable comparative analysis of topics across
different contexts to help discover interesting patterns and potentially interesting
events associated with the patterns.

These visualizations show the distribution of the coverage of the topic in different
weeks of the event over the states in the U.S. We see that initially, the coverage

coverage distribution pattern was very similar to that of the first week (shown on the
top left). This can again be explained by Hurricane Rita hitting the region around
