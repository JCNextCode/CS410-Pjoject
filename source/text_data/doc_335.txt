META’s confusion matrix output on a three-class classification problem.
accurate, with native English and Japanese as 80.7% and 99.1%, respectively. This
shows that while English and Chinese had relatively the same difficulty, Japanese
was very easy for the classifier to distinguish. We also see that if the classifier was
wrong in a prediction on a Chinese or English true label, it almost always chose
Japanese as the answer. Based on the matrix, the classifier seems to default to
the label “Japanese”. The table doesn’t tell us why this is, but we can make some
hypotheses based on our dataset. Based on this observation, we may want to tweak
our classifier’s parameters or do a more thorough feature analysis.
Bibliographic Notes and Further Reading
Text categorization has been extensively studied and is covered in Manning et al.
[2008]. An early survey of the topic can be found in Sebastiani [2002]; a more re-
cent one can be found in Aggarwal and Zhai [2012] where one chapter is devoted to
this topic. Yang [1999] includes a systematic empirical evaluation of multiple com-
monly used text categorization methods and a discussion of text categorization
evaluation. Moreover, since text categorization is often performed by using super-
vised machine learning, any book on machine learning is relevant (e.g., Mitchell
1997).
Exercises
15.1. In Section 15.4 we have two footnotes about sentence length feature gener-
ation. As they suggest, implement this tokenizer in META and see if one particular
dataset type benefits from this method or not.
15.2. Use META to experiment with document classification. Which of the k-NN
variants seems to perform the best? How dependent on the ranking function is the
k-NN accuracy?
15.3. In META, SVM is called SGD with hinge loss (the default classifier). Does SVM
always outperform Naive Bayes and k-NN? How do the runtimes in META compare
for these three learners?
