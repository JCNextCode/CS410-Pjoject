10.3 Link Analysis

page, and the edges between documents are hyperlinks connecting them to each
other. Let’s assume that a random surfer or random walker can be on any of these
pages. When the random surfer decides to move to a different page, they can either
randomly follow a link from the current page or randomly choose a document to
jump to from the entire collection. So, if the random surfer is at d1, with some
probability that random surfer will follow the links to either d3 or d4. The random
surfing model also assumes that the surfer might get bored sometimes and decide
to ignore the actual links, randomly jumping to any page on the web. If the surfer
takes that option, they would be able to reach any of the other pages even though
there is no link directly to that page. Based on this model, we can ask the question,
“How likely, on average, would the surfer reach a particular page?” This probability
is precisely what PageRank computes.
The PageRank score of a document di is the average probability that the surfer
visits di. Intuitively, this should be proportional to the inlink count. If a page has a
high number of inlinks then it would have a higher chance of being visited since
there will be more opportunities of having the surfer follow a link there. This is
how the random surfing model captures the idea of counting the inlinks. But, it
also considers the indirect inlinks; if the pages that point to di have themselves a
lot of inlinks, that would mean the random surfer would very likely reach one of
them. This increases the chance of visiting di. This is a nice way to capture both
indirect and direct links.
Mathematically, we can represent this document network as a matrix M, dis-
played in the center of Figure 10.7. Each row stands for a starting page. For example,
row one would indicate the probability of going to any of the four pages from d1.
We see there are only two non-zero entries. Each is one half since d1 is pointing to
only two other pages; thus if we can randomly choose to visit either of them from
d1, they’d each have a probability of 1
