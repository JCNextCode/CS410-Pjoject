Figure 20.3
Illustration of potential operators for text analysis.
Ranking. (WEIGHTED) TEXTOBJECTSET → TEXTOBJECTSEQUENCE. The Ranking
operator takes as input a weighted set of text objects that specifies the per-
spective of ranking and a set of text objects, and it produces a sequence
of text objects (sorted in order) as output. As a special case, the WEIGHTED
TEXTOBJECTSET can be a word distribution representing a query language
model.
TopicExtraction.
TEXTOBJECTSET → TOPICSET. The TopicExtraction operator
maps a set of text objects into a set of topics.
Interpret.
{TOPIC, TEXTOBJECTSET} → TEXTOBJECTSET. The Interpret operator
maps a topic and a set of text objects into another set of text objects.
Compare.
{TEXTOBJECTSET, . . . , TEXTOBJECTSET} → TOPICSET, . . . , TOPICSET. The
Compare operator maps a set of comparable sets of text objects into a set of
common topics covered in all the comparable sets of text objects, and sets of
context-specific topics.
The formalization of some of the operators is illustrated in Figure 20.4, where
θ denotes a weighted word vector. Even with these few operators, we already have
some interesting combinations. For example, in Figure 20.5, we see an example of
