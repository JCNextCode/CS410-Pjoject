Motivation of LARA.
hotel with five stars for value. Despite this, it might still be very expensive. If a
reviewer really cares about the value of a hotel, then the five-star review would most
likely mean a competitive price. In order to interpret the ratings on different aspects
accurately, we also need to know these aspect weights. When these different aspects
are combined together with specific weights for each user, we can have a much
more detailed understanding of the overall opinion.
Thus, the task is to take these reviews and their overall ratings as input and
generate both the aspect ratings and aspect weights as output. This is called Latent
Aspect Rating Analysis (LARA).
More specifically, we are given a set of review articles about a topic with overall
ratings, and we hope to generate three things. One is the major aspects commented
on in the reviews. Second is ratings on each aspect, such as value and room service.
Third is the relative weights placed on different aspects by each reviewer. This task
has many applications. For example, we can do opinion-based entity ranking or
we can generate an aspect-level opinion summary. We can also analyze reviewers’
preferences, compare them, or compare their preferences on different hotels. All
this enables personalized product recommendation.
As in other cases of these advanced topics, we won’t cover the technique in detail.
Instead, we will present a basic introduction to the technique developed for this
problem, asshowninFigure18.10.First, wewilltalkabouthowtosolvetheproblem
