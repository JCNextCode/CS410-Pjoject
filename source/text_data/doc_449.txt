knowledge or any preferences dictated by the user or application. This would lead
to a modification to the original optimization problem such that the likelihood is
no longer the only objective to optimize.
Following this thinking, the main idea of performing joint analysis of text and
associated network context is to use the network to impose some constraints on
the model parameters. For example, the text at adjacent nodes of the network can
be assumed to cover similar topics. Indeed, in many cases, they do tend to cover
similar topics; two authors collaborating with each other tend to publish papers
on similar topics. Such a constraint or preference would essentially attempt to
smooth the topic distributions on the graph or network so that adjacent nodes
will have very similar topic distributions. This means we expect them to share
a common distribution on the topics, or have just slight variations of the topic
coverage distribution.
We add a network-induced regularizer to the likelihood objective function, as
shown in Figure 19.10. That is, instead of optimizing the probability p(TextData |
�), we will optimize another function f , which combines the likelihood function
p(TextData | �) with a regularizer r(�, Network) defined based on whatever prefer-
ences we can derive from the network context. When optimizing the new objective
function f , we would seek a compromise between parameter values that maximize
the likelihood and those that satisfy our regularization constraints or preferences.
Thus we may also view the impact of the network context as imposing some prior
on the model parameters if we view the new optimization problem conceptually as
Bayesian inference of parameter values, even though we do not have any explicitly
defined prior distribution of parameters.
