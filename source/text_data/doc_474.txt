Extension of a search engine to create a general topic analysis engine.
This common structure for all tasks enables higher-level “wrapper” functions to
be implemented that act in the same way as previously described in this chapter.
For example:
.
TEXTOBJECT is represented in META as a meta::corpus::document
.
TEXTOBJECTSET is meta::index::forward_index or meta::index::
inverted_index
.
One example of a TEXTOBJECTSEQUENCE is meta::sequence::sequence.
.
One example of a WEIGHTEDTEXTOBJECTSEQUENCE is the output from the score
function in meta::index::ranker.
If we make higher-level functions that pass these objects to different analysis
components, we enable this unified view of text analysis. Using meta::corpus::
metadata allows basic structured data to be stored for each document. More ad-
vanced structured operations like those found in databases are not currently imple-
mented, but simple filtering and grouping commands are easily supported, such
asthefilteringfunctionsinmeta::index::rankerandmeta::classify::clas-
sifier::knn.
