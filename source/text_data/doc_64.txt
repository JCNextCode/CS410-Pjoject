easy task as compared with a more difficult task such as machine translation where
deep understanding of natural language is clearly required.
Figure 3.2 shows a number of TIS tasks that require somewhat different levels
of NLP. At one end of the spectrum, tasks such as retrieval and classification are
relatively easy, and in most of the cases, they don’t require deep NLP; indeed,
looking at the keywords mentioned in text is often sufficient to determine whether a
document is relevant to a query or about a certain topic. At the other end, however,
tasks such as machine translation and question answering would require much
more precise understanding; for example, a wrong parse of a sentence generally

structure, and similarly, a wrong understanding of the question would lead to
wrong answers.
When it comes to a specific application task, it is often possible to bypass the
difficulty in accurately understanding natural language and go directly to solve the
application problem. A well-known example is the Eliza system,2 which is supposed
to play the role of a therapist and make a dialogue with a human user [Weizenbaum
1966]. The following is a sample dialogue.
Person: Men are all alike.
