Text Retrieval
The most important tool for supporting text data access is a search engine, which
is why web search engines are used by many people on a daily basis. Search engines
directly provide support for querying and can be easily extended to provide recom-
mendation or browsing. Moreover, the techniques used to implement an effective
search engine are often also useful for implementation of a recommender system
as well as many text analysis functions. We thus devote a large portion of this book
to discussing search engine techniques.
In this section, we discuss the problem of text retrieval (TR), which is solved
by developing a search engine system. We specify the differences between un-
structured TR and structured database retrieval. We then make an argument for
document ranking as opposed to document selection. This provides a basis for us
to discuss in the next chapter how to rank documents for a query.
From a user’s perspective, the problem of TR is to use a query to find relevant
documents in a collection of text documents. This is a frequently needed task
because users often have temporary ad hoc information needs for various tasks,
