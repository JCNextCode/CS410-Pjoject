use the average document length as a pivot, or reference point. That means we will
assumethatfortheaveragelengthdocuments, thescoreisaboutright(anormalizer
would be one). If a document is longer than the average document length, then
there will be some penalization. If it’s shorter than the average document length,
there’s even some reward. The x-axis represents the length of a document. On the
y-axis we show the normalizer, i.e., the pivoted length normalization. The formula
for the normalizer is an interpolation of one and the normalized document lengths,
controlled by a parameter b. When we first divide the length of the document by
the average document length, this not only gives us some sense about how this
document is compared with the average document length, but also gives us the
benefit of not worrying about the unit of length. This normalizer has an interesting
property; first, we see that if we set the parameter b to zero, then the normalizer
value would be one, indicating no length normalization at all. If we set b to a
nonzero value, then the value would be higher for documents that are longer
than the average document length, whereas the value of the normalizer will be
smaller for shorter documents. In this sense we see there’s a penalization for
long documents and a reward for short documents. The degree of penalization is
controlled by b. By adjusting b (which varies from zero to one), we can control the
degree of length normalization. If we plug this length normalization factor into the
