Introduction
In the last two decades, we have experienced an explosive growth of online infor-
mation. According to a study done at University of California Berkeley back in 2003:
“. . . the world produces between 1 and 2 exabytes (1018 petabytes) of unique infor-
mation per year, which is roughly 250 megabytes for every man, woman, and child
on earth. Printed documents of all kinds comprise only .03% of the total.” [Lyman
et al. 2003]
A large amount of online information is textual information (i.e., in natural lan-
guage text). For example, according to the Berkeley study cited above: “Newspapers
represent 25 terabytes annually, magazines represent 10 terabytes . . . office docu-
ments represent 195 terabytes. It is estimated that 610 billion emails are sent each
year representing 11,000 terabytes.” Of course, there are also blog articles, forum
posts, tweets, scientific literature, government documents, etc. Roe [2012] updates
the email count from 610 billion emails in 2003 to 107 trillion emails sent in 2010.
According to a recent IDC report report [Gantz & Reinsel 2012], from 2005 to 2020,
the digital universe will grow by a factor of 300, from 130 exabytes to 40,000 ex-
abytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes.
While, in general, all kinds of online information are useful, textual information
plays an especially important role and is arguably the most useful kind of informa-
tion for the following reasons.
Text (natural language) is the most natural way of encoding human knowledge.
As a result, most human knowledge is encoded in the form of text data. For
example, scientific knowledge almost exclusively exists in scientific literature,
while technical manuals contain detailed explanations of how to operate
devices.
Text is by far the most common type of information encountered by people.
Indeed, most of the information a person produces and consumes daily is in
text form.
