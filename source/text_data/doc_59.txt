Text Data Understanding
In this chapter, we introduce basic concepts in text data understanding through
natural language processing (NLP). NLP is concerned with developing computa-
tional techniques to enable a computer to understand the meaning of natural
language text. NLP is a foundation of text information systems because how ef-
fective a TIS is in helping users access and analyze text data is largely determined
by how well the system can understand the content of text data. Content analysis
is thus logically the first step in text data analysis and management.
While a human can instantly understand a sentence in their native language,
it is quite challenging for a computer to make sense of one. In general, this may
involve the following tasks.
Lexical analysis.
The purpose of lexical analysis is to figure out what the basic
meaningful units in a language are (e.g., words in English) and determine
the meaning of each word. In English, it is rather easy to determine the
boundaries of words since they are separated by spaces, but it is non-trivial to
find word boundaries in some other languages such as Chinese where there
is no clear delimiter to separate words.
Syntactic analysis. The purpose of syntactic analysis is to determine how words
are related with each other in a sentence, thus revealing the syntactic structure
of a sentence.
Semantic analysis. The purpose of semantic analysis is to determine the mean-
ing of a sentence. This typically involves the computation of meaning of a
whole sentence or a larger unit based on the meanings of words and their
syntactic structure.
