also possible, which may be based on recognized entities and relations or other
techniques for more in-depth understanding of text.
With content analysis as the basis, there are multiple components in a TIS that
are useful for users in different ways. The following are some commonly seen
functions for managing and analyzing text information.
Search. Take a user’s query and return relevant documents. The search com-
ponent in a TIS is generally called a search engine. Web search engines are
among the most useful search engines that enable users to effectively and
efficiently deal with a huge amount of text data.
Filtering/Recommendation.
Monitor an incoming stream, decide which items
are relevant (or non-relevant) to a user’s interest, and then recommend rele-
vant items to the user (or filter out non-relevant items). Depending on whether
the system focuses on recognizing relevant items or non-relevant items, this
component in a TIS may be called a recommender system (whose goal is to
recommendrelevantitemstousers)orafilteringsystem(whosegoalistofilter
out non-relevant items to allow a user to keep only the relevant items). Liter-
ature recommender and spam email filter are examples of a recommender
system and a filtering system, respectively.
