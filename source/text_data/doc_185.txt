Bibliographic Notes and Further Reading
A classic reference book for the implementation of search engines is the book Man-
aging Gigabytes [Witten et al. 1999]. Other books on information retrieval, such
as Introduction to Information Retrieval [Manning et al. 2008], and Search Engines:
Information Retrieval in Practice [Croft et al. 2009], and Information Retrieval: Imple-
menting and Evaluating Search Engines [B¨uttcher et al. 2010] also have an excellent
coverage of implementations of search engines.
Exercises
8.1. Why is using an inverted index to score documents preferred over a more naive
solution?
8.2. For the following values, explain whether we can efficiently get the value from
a default (standard) inverted index postings file. By efficiently, we mean with one
lookup—not scanning the entire index.
Symbol
Value
|d|
total number of terms in a given doc
|d|u
number of unique terms in a given doc
df
number of documents a given term appears in
c(w, C)
number of times w occurs in the corpus
c(w, d)
count of w in d
p(w, d)
probability of w occurring in d
8.3. For values in the previous question that were not able to be extracted efficiently
from the postings file, either explain what auxiliary structures need to be searched
or why it isn’t possible to retrieve the value efficiently.
8.4. Imagine that each document is tagged with some sentiment score (either
positive or negative). Outline a method on how you could score documents if you
only wanted to return documents of a certain sentiment on a per-query basis.
8.5. Compress the following sequence of integers using each of the compression
methods discussed:
{34, 36, 39, 42, 47, 48, 49, 51}
8.6. According to Zipf’s law, which of the following strategies is more effective for
reducing the size of an inverted index? (1) Remove all words that appear 10 times
or less or (2) remove the top 10 most frequent words.
