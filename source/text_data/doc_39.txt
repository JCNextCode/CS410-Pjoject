of some key techniques important for text mining, notably the information extrac-
tion (IE) techniques which are essential for text mining. We decided not to cover IE
because the IE techniques tend to be language-specific and require non-trivial man-
ual work by humans. Another reason is that many IE techniques rely on supervised
machine learning approaches, which are well covered in many existing machine
learning books (see, e.g., Bishop 2006, Mitchell 1997). Readers who are interested
in knowing more about IE can start with the survey book [Sarawagi 2008] and review
articles [Jiang 2012].
From an application perspective, another important topic missing in this book
is information visualization, which is due to our focus on the coverage of models
and algorithms. However, since every application system must have a user-friendly
interface to allow users to optimally interact with a system, those readers who are
interested in developing text data application systems will surely find it useful to
learn more about user interface design. An excellent reference to start with is Hearst
[2009], which also has a detailed coverage of information visualization.
Finally, due to our emphasis on breadth, the book does not cover any compo-
nent algorithm in depth. To know more about some of the topics, readers can
further read books in natural language processing (e.g., Jurafsky and Martin 2009,
Manning and SchÂ¨utze 1999), advanced books on IR (e.g., Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-
Neto [2011]), and books on machine learning (e.g., Bishop [2006]). You may find
more specific recommendations of readings relevant to a particular topic in the
Bibliographic Notes at the end of each chapter that covers the corresponding topic.
